# Childsplay Site Documentation:

## Introduction

Hello! The Childsplay site has been writetn in React, a very common (at the time of writing this) JS library for web applications.
<br></br>
If all you need to do is change the text in the website, this can be done directly though GitHub's built-in editor to modify many elements of the page, including the text
within the paragraph tags.<br></br>
However, if you'd like to make more comprehensive changes, such as adding a page, changing the layout, etc..., please clone the repository and edit the site locally. To do this, follow the instructions below. As a note, I've also left in the default React ReadMe information in case this is helpful.


## Step 1 - Install Node.js

To get started in development, you'll need to install Node.js. This is a super popular tool that has a lot of great tutorials and documentation on the web. To get started, <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/'>go here to download the current version</a> (note that if this link doesn't work, simply Google "install Node.js"). <br></br><br></br>



## Step 2 - Clone the repository and install required packages

After you've installed Node.js, you'll want to clone this repository. Once that's been done, you can open a terminal, and navigate to the location of your cloned repository on your desktop. Once there, you'll need to run the command `npm install` to install the libraries that were used in this project. A complete list can be found in package.json file.
<br></br><br></br>

## Step 3 - Start a local version of the site

Now you can start a local copy of the site! To do this, run the `npm start` command in your terminal. This will start the site on localhost 3000, and should automatically open a browser tab to this address. <br></br><br></br>


## Step 4 - Make edits locally in React

Once your site is up and running, you'll be able to make changes and edits in React. There are lots of resources on React if you need a hand figuring out development, but I'll make some project-specific notes here that might be useful:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
